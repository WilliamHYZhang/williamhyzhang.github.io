## Hello, World

Welcome to my website :)

### About

I'm currently a junior at [Ward Melville](http://www.threevillagecsd.org/schools/ward_melville_high_school) High School in Setauket, NY. Outside of school I'm very fortunate to be a software engineer at [Clay](https://clay.run/) and student researcher with [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

Outside of professional work you can find me tinkering on random side projects, jamming on the sax/drums, or just chilling.

### Experience

I spent wayyy too long on figuring out \LaTeX for my "rEsUMe" so I'm just linking it [here](/pdf/resume.pdf).

### Cool Stuff

Fun projects [here](/cool_stuff).

### Blog

Thoughts on the [blog](/blog).
