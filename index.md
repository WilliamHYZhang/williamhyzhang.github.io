Welcome to my website :)

### About

I'm currently a junior at [Ward Melville](http://www.threevillagecsd.org/schools/ward_melville_high_school) High School in Setauket, NY. Outside of school I do a bunch of CS related stuff, i.e. software engineering, research, and outreach.

Besides professional work you can find me tinkering on random side projects, jamming on the sax/drums, or pretty much whatever perks my interest.
